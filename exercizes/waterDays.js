/*
Let’s say we have a plant that we need to water once a week on Wednesdays. We could define a function expression to help us check the day of the week and if the plant needs to be watered:

- Create a variable named plantNeedsWater using the const variable keyword.
- Assign an anonymous function that takes in a parameter of day to plantNeedsWater.
- In the function body add an if conditional that checks day === 'Wednesday'.
- If the conditional is truthy, inside the if code block, use the return keyword to return true.
- Add a condition so that on days that aren’t 'Wednesday', plantNeedsWater() should return false.
- Call the plantNeedsWater() and pass in 'Tuesday' as an argument.
- Test your code: Log plantNeedsWater('Tuesday') to the console. If it worked correctly, you should see false logged to the console.
